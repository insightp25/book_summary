## neural networks

- "neural networks are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that consitute animal brains."
- neural networks are function approximators that stack affine transformations(행렬을 곱함) followed by nonlinear transformations(eg, activation function).

## linear neural networks

- data, model, loss
- 목적: 나의 N개의 데이터를 잘 설명할 수 있는 모델을 찾는 것. 모델의 출력값과 실제 데이터의 차이를 줄이는 것.
- of course, we can handle multi-dimensional input and output.

## beyond linear neural networks

- wee need nonlinearity.
- activation functions
  - eg. ReLU, sigmoid, hyperbolic tagent
- caution: it only garuntees the existence of such networks

## multi-layer perceptron

- this class of architectures are often called multi-layer perceptrons.
